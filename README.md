# Trivia game

You have been assigned a new trivia game prototype. Your task is to build a fully functional experience that meets the requirements below.

You received a partial, rough design. It is missing some layouts, features, and design details. As you develop the game, add those missing aspects in your prototype by extending the theme in the provided designs. You may also augment your own features or break away from the theme entirely reskinning the experience if you like. Consider features not included in the design such as a timer.
